<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are a plethora of discord bots available for users with a simple Google search, however it was difficult for me to find any that suited my needs
so I decided to create my own. I needed a bot that could at the most basic level, alert users of important cryptocurrency movements and events.

Here's why:
* I wanted to familiarize myself with the Twitter and CoinGecko APIs
* I wanted to learn how to build my own discord bot
* I wanted to create a bot that directly suited my needs

This project is still currently in its early stages so some features may change or be removed depending on how useful I find them after extended use.

### Built With

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
* [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/)
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
* [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
